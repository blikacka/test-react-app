# Functional requirements

Develop SPA for searching users on Github using their usernames. Application will consist of search area and profile info area. Once user is found, additional user information will be shown(username, name, bio, profile picture), list of his repositories with detail info (name, technology, description) and following users(username) - show only one of list at the time (tab-like). 
The searched user will be shareable via url link, the repositories and following users will be also switchable via url link. Users in list of following users will be links to the search of their profile. 

# Technical requirements

Use github API and tech stack of your choice (Typescript, GraphQL stack prefered).
Application should use routing library (react-router / reach-router).
Any use of translation library (react-intl, react-i18next) is appreciated.
Styles can be normal css / scss or css-in-js (styled-components, emotion, etc.) You can use your prefered UI kit library (eg. material-ui)
